## Hello Lepaya!

Welcome to my assignment! It's the memory card game. You can play it [right here](https://card-game-for-lepaya.netlify.com). Now, to the fun stuff:

### So, what does this do?
It's a memory game! You'll be showed a number of cards for a few seconds - you gotta remember what those are. Once they disappear, click on the buttons in ascending order. For example, you'll be shown:
99 7 56 23
So you gotta click on the buttons where 7 was, then 23, 56 and 99.

There are 3 levels: easy (with 4 numbers), medium (8) and hard (12). The length of time to remember the numbers is longer for harder levels (phew). 

### Some instructions
How to run this locally:
* ```git clone```
* ```npm install```
* ```npm run start```
Now you can see it at http://localhost:3000 (unless something else is running there... but you'd have been warned!)
